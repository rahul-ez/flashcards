What is the term for the private workspace on the stack created when a subroutine is entered and freed when it returns?,A stack frame.
"In a typical stack frame, what register is set to point to a fixed location within the frame to provide a stable reference point for parameters and local variables?",The Frame Pointer (FP).
"Typically, the first two instructions in a subroutine that uses a stack frame are `Move FP, -(SP)` and `Move SP, FP`. What is the purpose of this sequence?",To save the old frame pointer on the stack and then establish the new frame pointer for the current subroutine.
